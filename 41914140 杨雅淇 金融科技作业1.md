# Introduction
* Course introduction
- What is IT?
+ What does an IT support specialist do?
# History of computing
+ From Abacus to Analytical Engine
    *Computer-a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations
+ The path to modern computers
    *Cryptography*-the art of writing and solving codes
	*ENIAC*-the earliest form of general computers
	*Compiler n. 编译器*--human language to programming            language machine code 
# Digital logic
+ Computer language
	*Binary system-*-the communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numeral system
+ Character encoding
+ Binary
+ How to count in Binary
# Computer Architecture layer
+ Abstraction
- Computer architecture overview
    *Hardware layer*--made up of the physical components of a computer
	- Operating system
		·softer layer--how we as humans interact with our computer
		·user--programming/apply knowledge into it
# The modern computer

- Programs and hardware
# Components
+ CPU
- RAM
* Motherboards
* Storage

    *Data sizes*---8 bits->1 byte; 1024 bytes->1 kilobyte(KB)
	- Hard dives--保护数据不丢失
		Two types:
        1. Hard disk dives &HDD--Read and write data faster （the speed---RPM--revolution per minute---More affordable /more prone to damage.
		2. Solid state drive（SSD）--less risky to losing data/more expensive
	- interfaces：
		1. ATA interface--Serial ATA(most popular drive)/SATA---speed对于SSD不够
		2. NVMe/NVM express
    - Ports-connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer
	- CPU(central processing unit-- the brain of our computer ,it does all the calculations and data processing
	- RAM(random access memory--our computer's short-term memory
	- Hard drive--holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications(long-term memory
	- Motherboard--the body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together

* Power supplies
* Peripherals
# The modern computer
- Module introduction

**Human language---bianry/computer language**
1. *programs*--instructions that tell the computer what to do
2. *EDB*-external data bus(different speed eg. 16-bit; 64-bit…
3. *Register*     只用0/1表达 ram---cpu read info
4. *Memory controller chip*(MCC--bridge between CPU&RAM
5. Address bus
6. *cache*--3 different cache levels in a CPU:   
   L1(smallest&fastest) ,L2,L3
7. clock wire--calculation
8. *clock speed*--the maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period--3.4 gigahertz is 3.4 billion cycles per second.

# What is an operating system?
- components of an operating system
- files and file systems
- process management
- memory management
- I/O management


![同一目录下的图片引用](./金融科技1.png)

**I/O devices**--devices that perform input and output
  When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine, it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency
*Operating system*: the whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets us interest with it.
 
   Two parts:
       1. kernel 
        File storage & management/ file system / Process management/Memory management 
        our kernel optimize memory usage and makes sure our applications have enough memory to run
        Input/output(I/O management--anything that can give us input ,or that we can use for output of data

        2. user space
        Everything outside the kernel   eg. Programming/text editors..
